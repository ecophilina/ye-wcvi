Spatial restrictions hinder avoidance of choke species in an Indigenous rights-based fishery. 
People and Nature. DOI: 10.1002/pan3.10554.

The data used includes survey data that is publically available through Open Data 
(trawl:https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a278d1af-d567-4964-a109-ae1e84cbd24a; 
HBLL: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3cdc1ad5-70e5-4fac-865d-e583e54d15df) and 
spatially explicit commercial data, which are not publicly available due to Canada's privacy laws. 
As a result these scripts will not be possible to run for anyone not working for DFO.

Primary data retrieval and analysis scripts are numbered in the order that they must be run. 
Scripts with 00 must be run before all others, but the order between them doesn't matter. 
Scripts without numbers are for plotting, or supplementary tests, after main analysis is complete.
