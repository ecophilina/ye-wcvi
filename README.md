The data used include survey data that are publicly available through Canada's Open Data 
(trawl:https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a278d1af-d567-4964-a109-ae1e84cbd24a; 
HBLL: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3cdc1ad5-70e5-4fac-865d-e583e54d15df) and 
spatially explicit commercial data, which are not publicly available due to Canada's privacy laws. 
As a result, these scripts will not be possible to run for anyone without access to these data.

Primary data retrieval and analysis scripts are numbered in the order that they must be run. 
Scripts with 00 must be run before all others, but the order between them doesn't matter. 
Scripts without numbers are for plotting, or supplementary tests, and need to be run 
after the main analysis is complete.
