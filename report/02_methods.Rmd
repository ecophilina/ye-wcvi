# Methods {#sec:methods}

We used data collected on the southern outside Hard Bottom Longline survey (HBLL) and the synoptic bottom trawl survey to estimate the spatial and temporal variation in expected catches of YE and halibut.
The HBLL survey focuses on rockfish habitats (i.e. non-trawlable habitats), rather than the broader range of habitats and depths that halibut occupy.
This survey is usually conducted in alternating years, except that no survey occurred in 2012 and 2013.
The synoptic trawl surveys sample soft-bottom habitats, but use trawl gear and record biomass densities, rather than fish counts as on the HBLL.
Two trawl surveys overlap spatially with the HBLL: the southern portion with the West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey conducted in even years (except 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and the northern portion with the Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey conducted in odd years. 
The data from both surveys are available through Open Data (trawl: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a278d1af-d567-4964-a109-ae1e84cbd24a;
HBLL: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3cdc1ad5-70e5-4fac-865d-e583e54d15df).
To join, or "stitch", these three surveys together and produce estimates of local variation in biomass density, we pooled odd and even year pairs and converted the catch counts from the HBLL into biomass densities.

To incorporate observations from both survey types into one model, the observations needed to be converted into comparable units.
For YE, we converted HBLL catch counts to biomass using an estimate of mean fish weight (all fish measured across all years on this survey).
For halibut, individual fish weights or lengths were not collected and fish smaller than 81.3 cm cannot be kept, so HBLL catch counts were converted to a landable biomass density by multiplying counts by the average total landed biomass per fish caught.
These biomass estimates for HBLL catch were further divided by the "area swept" calculation of hook count $\times$ a hook spacing of 0.0024384 km (8 ft) $\times$ an assumed catch radius of 0.009144 km (30 ft).
For the trawl survey halibut biomass, the estimated densities were multiplied by the proportion of biomass caught that belonged to landable individuals at the set-level, where at least 10 fish, or greater than 70% by weight of the total catch, were measured.
In cases where these criteria were not met, we used the global mean across all sets.
<!-- YE biomass densities from the trawl survey were left unadjusted because -->
For YE, the mean weights per fish were nearly identical between the two surveys (synoptic surveys = `r round(yemeanweightSYN, 2)` kg; HBLL = `r round(yemeanweightHBLL, 2)` kg).
<!-- Finally, all densities were converted from kg per kg/km2 to kg per ha for computational reasons. -->
We did not account for hook competition because the goal here was to estimate likely catch ratios and not the underlying abundances.
Furthermore, an investigation into hook competition for YE in the latest outside YE stock assessment found little effect of accounting for it [@coxEvaluationPotentialRebuilding2020].

## Modelling

We then fit geostatistical spatiotemporal models to these surveyed biomass densities.
Because these biomass densities include both zeros and positive continuous values, we used either a Tweedie distribution or a delta-Gamma (a binomial distribution for presence-absence and a Gamma distribution for the positive component) approach to model predicted catches of each species.
The Tweedie model fit the data well for YE (Fig. \@ref(fig:qq-ye)), while for landable halibut the delta-Gamma models fit better than the Tweedie (Fig. \@ref(fig:qq-hal)).
For both species, we included quadratic effects of depth, and the proportions of rocky and muddy substrate [from a 100 $times$ 100 m resolution raster; @haggartyDeepSubstrate1002018] within 1 km of the sampling location, to help account for difference in the habitats targeted by each survey.
We included a factor for survey type to capture differences in catchability between the two fishing methods.
These models also estimated annual means for years and latent "random fields" representing remaining patterns in spatial and spatiotemporal correlation that were not explicitly modelled by the included covariates.
<!-- Might these next two sentences belong in the start of the results? -->
The magnitude of spatiotemporal variation was much higher for halibut than for YE, but including spatiotemporal variation improved model fit compared to models with only spatial random fields for each species by over 10 AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) units.
Allowing for anisotropy improved the delta AIC (>10) for the YE model, but interfered with estimatation of spatiotemporal fields for the halibut models.
<!-- For Halibut, including a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation between spatiotemporal fields only marginally improved model fit (~5 $\Delta$ AIC), so we used independent spatiotemporal fields for both species. -->
  <!-- SA: add equations?-->

For YE, we modelled biomass density $D$ for point in space $s$ and time $t$ as
\begin{align}
  D_{s,t} &\sim \operatorname{Tweedie} \left(\mu_{s,t}, p, \phi \right), \: 1 < p < 2\ ,
\end{align}
where $\mu_{s,t}$ represents the expected (mean) value, $p$ represents the Tweedie power parameter, and $\phi$ represents the Tweedie dispersion parameter. We modelled $\mu_{s,t}$ as a function of a series of fixed and random effects and a log link:
\begin{align}
  \mu_{s,t} &= \exp 
  \left(\alpha_t + \bm{X}_{s,t} \bm{\beta} + \omega_s + \epsilon_{s,t} \right),\\
  \bm{\omega} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \bm{0}, \bm{\Sigma}_\omega \right),\\
  \bm{\epsilon}_t &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \bm{0}, \bm{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} \right),
\end{align}
where $\alpha_t$ represents a mean for each year, $\bm{X}_{s,t}$ represents a vector of predictors (survey ID, depth, depth squared, and a spline [with a basis dimension of 3] for proportion rocky and proportion muddy), and $\bm{\beta}$ represents a vector of corresponding parameters.
The symbol $\omega_s$ represents spatially correlated random effects that are constant through time, which are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix $\bm{\Sigma}_\omega$ (a "random field").
This covariance matrix is constrained via the Matérn covariance function.
The symbol $\epsilon_{s,t}$ represents spatially correlated random effects that are independent each year (spatiotemporal random effects), similarly constrained by multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix $\bm{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}$ and a Matérn covariance function.

Our halibut model followed the same form as the YE model, but modelled biomass density as a product of two component models:

\begin{align}
  D_{s,t} &\sim 
  \operatorname{Bernoulli} \left( \varphi_{s,t} \right) \cdot
    \operatorname{Gamma} \left( \vartheta, \frac{\mu_{2,s,t}}{\vartheta} \right),
\end{align}

where $\varphi_{s,t}$ represents the expected probability of catching any halibut in a given observation, $\mu_{2,s,t}$ represents the expected value conditional on a positive observation and $\vartheta$ represents the Gamma distribution shape parameter ($\mu_{s,t} / \vartheta$ represents the Gamma scale).
These two components are modelled with logit and log links with a form similar to the YE model:

\begin{align}
  \varphi_{s,t} &= \operatorname{logit}^{-1} 
  \left(\alpha_{1,t} + \bm{X}_{1,s,t} \bm{\beta_1} + \omega_{1,s} + \epsilon_{1,s,t} \right),\\
    \mu_{2,s,t} &= \exp 
  \left(\alpha_{2,t} + \bm{X}_{2,s,t} \bm{\beta_2} + \omega_{2,s} + \epsilon_{2,s,t} \right).
\end{align}

The symbols have the same meaning as in the YE equations, but the subscript 1 and 2 denote the equivalent parameters from the first (Bernoulli) and second (Gamma) component models.

We fit all our models in R version 3.6.3 [@R2020] with the R package sdmTMB [@anderson2019synopsis; @sdmTMB] version 0.0.18.9000, which combines automatic differentiation and the Laplace approximation from the TMB (Template Model Builder) R package [@kristensen2016] with the SPDE (Stochastic Partial Differential Equation) approximation to Gaussian Markov fields from the INLA R package [@rue2009].
sdmTMB carries out optimization using the non-linear minimization function `nlminb` in R and finds the value of the fixed effects that minimizes the marginal negative log likelihood.
We confirmed the models were consistent with convergence by checking that the Hessian matrix was positive definite and the maximum absolute gradient across fixed effects was $< 0.005$.

We also built models based on just the HBLL data to confirm that stitching the HBLL and synoptic surveys was still representative of the HBLL survey results.
For this count-based model, we used a negative binomial observation likelihood ('NB2') with a log link and an an offset for the number of hooks.
This means we modelled fish caught per hook, but with a statistical approach that let us use a count distribution.
The NB2 distribution lets the observation variance scale quadratically with the mean, which is typically needed for ecological data.
This model also includes a quadratic effect of depth, but no substrate habitat variables.

## Spatial predictions

Next, we generated expected densities for the entire survey area if sampling was done using HBLL survey gear.
For halibut, this produced an estimate of landable biomass densities, while for YE it was for total catchable biomass densities.
To do this, we created a `filled in' grid encompassing the entire HBLL survey grid using the following series of steps:

1. Using centroids from the HBLL survey grid split at 50.5 degrees N, we made two bounding boxes that excluded the inland side of Vancouver Island. The southern box was then expanded farther south to the southern and eastern extent of the WCVI trawl grid. 
2. For the area within each box, we extracted the 20 m and 1000m contour lines, and extracted only the points on these lines that form continous depth contours that intersect with the box boundaries (ie. excluding contours around small offshore islands).
3. We created a polygon folling the path of these points and the NW corner of the northern box (this was necessary because this is well within the depth boundaries).
4. This polygon was turned into a grid of 2 $\times$ 2 km cells.
5. Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) were clipped out because they prohibit commercial groundfish harvesting.
6. Area below sea-level was calculated for each grid cell (including partial ones).
7. Mean depth and substrate proportions were then extracted for those areas below sea level.
8. Finally, we kept only cells (and partial cells) with mean depths between 2 to 600 m, because that best matched the outline of both survey grids.
<!-- These estimates were then used to produce maps of expected biomass distributions for each species, as well as the spatial distribution of expected catch ratios between these species. -->

We derived uncertainty on the predictions for each grid cell ($D_{j,t}$) by simulating 500 draws from the estimated (multivariate normal) joint precision matrix. We then used these draws to calculate uncertainty on the biomass estimates $B_t$ (Eq. \@ref(eq:Bt)), which we summarized at specific quantiles. This approach avoids the need to account for any re-transformation bias of the random effects [e.g., as in @thorson2016a] and facilitates calculating uncertainty on derived quantites combined from multiple models such as the ratio of YE to halibut biomass.

## Area-specific indices

These expected densities were multiplied by the area below sea-level within survey grid cells to produce overall biomass indices, and overall average biomass ratios for different subregions (within the CDA vs. Area 3CD5A outside the CDA and Area 3CD5A north of 50º vs. Area 3CD5A south of 50º and outside the CDA; Fig. \@ref(fig:region-col-key)).
Splitting at 50º separates the areas adjacent to the CDA from those not adjacent, as well as accounting for potential ecological or latitudinal variation implied by a positive correlation between HBLL catch counts of halibut and YE in the south, but not in the north (Fig. \@ref(fig:hbll-catch)).
Specifically, we calculated biomass $B_t$ (or abundance) indexes for each biennial year combination $t$ by summing the predicted biomass in every grid cell $j$ (1 through $n_j$) weighted by the cell area ($w_j$):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bt}
B_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{n_j} w_j  D_{j,t}.
\end{equation}


In addition to biennial estimates of average relative biomass, we used cell-specific biomass estimates to explore how contrasting fishing strategies might affect expected catch ratios for a given total area of each region.
We examined two strategies: (1) select cells to 'fish' in order from lowest to highest YE densities or (2) select cells to 'fish' with the highest to lowest halibut densities.
<!-- TODO: a bit more here about what this can show and exactly what was done? -->
Only 2 $\times$ 2 km grid cells were considered in these scenarios. 
Biomass densities in kg/ha were also converted to mass per 100 hooks by multiplying cell densities by (100 hooks * 0.0024384 km * 0.009144 km) and resulting mean ratios assume an equal number of hooks were set in each grid cell encompassing the total cumulative area 'fished'. 
Selected grid cells can be anywhere within the subregion. 
To avoid unrealistic catch ratios, when expected halibut biomass of less than 1 g per 100 hooks have been truncated to this value.
This approach provides an estimate of the range of catch ratios one could expect from fishing, rather than an overall estimate of the relative biomass present in an entire region.
