	abstract = {Environmental variability affects the distributions of most marine fish species. In this analysis, assemblages of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) species were defined on the basis of similarities in their distributions along environmental gradients. Data from 14 bottom trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (n=6767) were used. Five distinct assemblages of rockfish were defined by geographical position, depth, and temperature. The 180-m and 275-m depth contours were major divisions between assemblages inhabiting the shelf, shelf break, and lower continental slope. Another noticeable division was between species centered in southeastern Alaska and those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands. The use of environmental variables to define the species composition of assemblages is different from the use of traditional methods based on clustering and nonparametric statistics and as such, environmentally based analyses should result in predictable assemblages of species that are useful for ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {The British Columbia longline fishery for Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) has experienced important recent management changes, including the introduction of comprehensive electronic catch monitoring on all vessels; an integrated transferable quota system; a reduction in Pacific halibut quotas; and, beginning in 2016, sharp decreases in quota for yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus, an incidentally caught species). We describe this fishery before integration, after integration, and after the yelloweye rockfish quota reduction using spatial clustering methods to define discrete fishing opportunities. We calculate the relative utilization of these fishing opportunities and their overlap with areas with high encounter rates of yelloweye rockfish during each of the three periods. The spatial footprint (area fished) increased before integration, then decreased after integration. Each period showed shifts in utilization among four large fishing areas. Immediately after the reductions in yelloweye rockfish quota, fishing opportunities with high encounter rates of yelloweye rockfish had significantly lower utilization than areas with low encounter rates, implying rapid avoidance behaviour.},
