# Results {#sec:results}

Estimates from models based on both surveys showed similar patterns for the regions captured by the HBLL survey when compared to estimates from models built on just the HBLL survey data alone (Fig. \@ref(fig:hbll-v-hybrid)).
Therefore, the general index trends from our combined model does not appear to have been affected substanially by the added complexity and assumptions involved in producing the the combined models.
The models also estimate the depth preferences, and effects of proportion of rocky and muddy habitats within 1 km on biomass of each species (Fig. \@ref(fig:effect-plots)).

DO WE REPORT EFFECTS SURVEY TYPE?
  DO WE WANT COEFFICIENT TABLES OF ANY KIND?


  These models produce biennial estimates of the spatial distribution of biomass density for each species (Figs \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-all) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-all)).
However, we will focus on the predicted spatial variation for the most recent years in our survey data (2018 through 2020 in order to have complete spatial coverage) and prediction for 2019 and 2020 combined (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-2020) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-2020)).
<!-- SA: clarify? 2019-2020 or 2018-2020; I'm confused here -->
<!-- PE: This is accurate. It is because we don't have trawl data for the southern area in the 2019-2020 year pairing. In the faceted figure you can see which year pair samples belong to, but for the zoomed in figures I wanted to see how well trawl samples were represented in the south... possibly I should average predications across those final two sets of years for these zoomed in figures and make it 2017-2020 for both?-->
  Due to generally higher biomass densities in the north, zooming in on the area immediately around the CDA (Area 3CD5A south of 50ยบ) is also useful (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-2020-closeup) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-2020-closeup)).
The predictions for both species can also be mapped as ratios to identify locations at particular risk of higher YE catch (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-per-hal-preds-2020)) or locations that are particularly productive for halibut, while minimizing YE catch (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-per-ye-preds-2020)).

The CDA covers `r r2(((sum(cda_grid$area)/10000) / ((sum(cda_grid$area)/10000) + (sum(noncda_grid$area)/10000)))*100)`% of Area 3CD5A's total surveyed area, excluding RCAs.
This area was estimated to contain `r r2(rel_hal_3CD5A$ratio_mean*100)`% (95% CI: `r r2(rel_hal_3CD5A$ratio_lwr*100)` to `r r2(rel_hal_3CD5A$ratio_upr*100)`) of estimated total landable Halibut biomass in the surveyed portion of area 3CD5A.
Meanwhile, the CDA was estimated to contain `r r2(rel_ye_3CD5A$ratio_mean*100)`% (95% CI: `r r2(rel_ye_3CD5A$ratio_lwr*100)` to `r r2(rel_ye_3CD5A$ratio_upr*100)`) of estimated total YE biomass in the surveyed portion of area 3CD5A.
We estimated the average landed Halibut biomass density inside CDA to be `r r2(i_hal_cda2020$est / (sum(cda_grid$area)/1000000))` kg/km2 (95% CI: `r r2(i_hal_cda2020$lwr / (sum(cda_grid$area)/1000000))` to `r r2(i_hal_cda2020$upr / (sum(cda_grid$area)/1000000))`), which is lower than the average of `r r2(i_hal_noncda2020$est / (sum(noncda_grid$area)/1000000))` kg/km^2^ (95% CI: `r r2(i_hal_noncda2020$lwr / (sum(noncda_grid$area)/1000000))` to `r r2(i_hal_noncda2020$upr / (sum(noncda_grid$area)/1000000))`; Fig. \@ref(fig:indexes-avg) A) ) in area 3CD5A outside CDA.
However, this difference was much less than the in average YE biomass density between areas.

The ratio of YE to halibut within the CDA was on average lower overall (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-through-time)).
If the same number of cells from the CDA or non-CDA 3CD5A were selected that have the highest density of landable halibut, the expected ratio of YE to landable halibut would not differ qualitatively between the areas (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-scenario)A).
However, if selecting cells to avoid YE, the ratio of YE to landable halibut biomass expected within the CDA would increasing sharply once more than 10% (or >250 kg/km^2^) of the CDA was sampled, while a lower YE ratio could be maintained while sampling from an equivelent area until the sampled area exceeded approximately `r signif(non_cda_exceeds_cda, digits = 2)` km2 of the non-CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-scenario)).
