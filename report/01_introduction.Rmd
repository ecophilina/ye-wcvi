# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

"Choke" species are species with limited quota that co-occur with species of fishing interest and therefore limit fishing opportunities. 
In British Columbia Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*, hereafter: YE) are a known choke species for the Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*, hereafter: halibut) fishery [@forrestEvidenceRapidAvoidance2020a].
Five Nations hold Aboriginal rights to a multi-species fishery that includes YE and halibut.
A 2018 court decision, *Ahousaht Indian Band and Nation* v *Canada* outlined the area of each of the Five Nations’ individual Fishing Territories, which combined are referred to as the Court Defined Area (CDA). 
This type of restricted harvest area within a larger management area raises issues regarding how expected catch ratios of choke and target species might vary at finer spatial scales than normally assessed. 
In this report, we explore the potential for spatiotemporal geostatistical models based on fishery-independent survey data to aid in predicting relative catches of YE and halibut within the CDA and in the management area immediately surrounding it (Groundfish Management Unit area 3CD5A). 

# Methods {#sec:methods}

We use data collected on southern outside Hard Bottom Longline survey (HBLL) and synoptic trawl surveys (TRAWL) to estimate the spatial and temporal variation in expected catches of YE and halibut. 
The HBLL survey focuses on rockfish habitats, rather than a broader range of habitats and depths that halibut occupy. 
This survey is usually conducted in alternating years, except that no survey occurred in both 2012 and 2013. 
The synoptic trawl surveys sample soft-bottom habitats, but use a different gear type and record biomass densities, rather than fish counts as on the HBLL. 
Two trawl surveys overlap spatially with the HBLL Outside South Survey: the southern portion with the West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey conducted in even years (except 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic), and the northern portion with the Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey conducted in odd years.
In order to join, or "stitch", these three surveys together and produce estimates of local variation in biomass density, we pooled odd and even year pairs and converted the catch counts from the HBLL into biomass densities. 

In order to incorporate observations from both survey types into one model, they also needed to be in the same units. 
For YE, we converted HBLL catch counts to biomass using an estimate of mean weight (currently using all fish measured across all years on this same survey). 
For halibut, individual fish weights or lengths were not collected and fish smaller than 81.3 cm cannot be kept, so HBLL catch counts are converted to a landable biomass density by multiplying counts by the average total landed biomass per fish caught. 
These biomass estimates for HBLL catch were further divided by the "area swept" calculation of hook count x a hook spacing of 0.0024384 km) x an assumed catch radius of 0.009144 km and converted from kg/km2.
For the trawl survey halibut biomass densities, the estimated density was multiplied by the proportion of biomass caught that belonged to landable individuals at the set-level where at least 10 fish, or greater than 70% by weight of the total catch were measured, or the global mean across all sets in all years when not.
YE biomass densities from the trawl survey were left on adjusted because the mean weight per fish were nearly identical between the surveys (TRAWL = `r round(yemeanweightSYN, 2)` kg; HBLL = `r round(yemeanweightHBLL, 2)` kg kg). <!-- and similar to placeholder value from IFMP that represents mean of landed commercial catch (`r round(yemeanweight, 2)` kg). -->
All densities were then converted from kg per kg/km2 to kg per ha. 

Next, we fit geostatistical spatiotemporal models to these surveyed biomass densities using the R package sdmTMB <https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB>. 
Because these biomass densities include both zeros and positive continuous values, we used a Tweedie distribution to model predicted catches of each species. 
We are not accounting for hook competition in any of these models because the goal here is to estimate likely catch ratios and not the underlying abundances. 
For both species, we included quadratic effects of depth, and the proportions of rocky and muddy substrate within 1km of the sampling location to help account for difference in the habitats targeted by each survey, and a factor for survey type to capture differences in catchability between the two fishing methods. 
Finally, these models also estimated annual means for years, and latent "random fields" representing remaining spatial and spatiotemporal correlation that is not explicitely modelled by the included covariates. 
Spatiotemporal correlation was much higher for Halibut than from YE, but improved model fit for both > delta 10 AIC. 
For Halibut, including an AR1 correlation between spatiotemporal fields only marginally improved model fit (~5 AIC), so we used independent spatiotemporal fields for both species. 
**should we add any diagnostic and validation plots?**

<!-- **should we include this bit and the comparison fig?** -->
We also built models based on just the HBLL data to confirm that stiching of the survey types was still representative of the HBLL survey results.
For this count-based model we used a negative binomial observation model with a log link and an an 'offset' for number of hooks.
This means we are modelling fish caught per hook, but with a statistical approach that lets us use a count distribution.
The negative binomial distribution lets the observation variance scale quadratically with the mean, which is typically needed for this type of data.
This model also includes a quadratic effect of depth, but no substrate habitat variables. 

We then calculated expected biomass densities if sampled using HBLL gear, for only those latitudes and depths covered in the HBLL survey and excluding locations within an Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) where all fishing is prohibited. 
For halibut, this was an estimate of landable biomass, while for YE it is for total catchable biomass. 
These estimates were then used to produce maps of expected biomass distributions for each species, as well as the spatial distibution of expected catch ratios between these species.  
These expected densities were also multiplied by the area of surveyed grid cells (usually 2 x 2 km), and adjacent portions of cells where part falls inside RCAs, to produce overall biomass indices and overall average biomass ratios for different subregions (within the CDA vs. area 3CD5A outside the CDA, or area 3CD5A north of 50º vs. area 3CD5A south of 50º and outside the CDA; Fig. \@ref(fig:region-col-key)). 
Splitting at 50º separates the areas adjacent to the CDA from those not, as well as accounting for potential ecological or latitudinal variation implied by a positive correlation between HBLL catch counts of Halibut and YE in the S, but not in the N (Fig. \@ref(fig:hbll-catch)). 
Finally, cell-specific biomass estimates were used to explore how contrasting fishing strategies, either selection only those cells with the lowest YE densities or only those cells with the highest halibut densitiesm, might affect expected catch ratios for a given total area of each region. 
All estimates were simulated 500 times to produce confidence intervals (CI).

# Results {#sec:results}

Estimates from models based on both surveys showed very similar patterns for the regions of captured by the HBLL survey when compared to estimates from models built on just the HBLL survey data alone Fig. \@ref(fig:hbll-v-hybrid)).
Therefore, we have confidence that the estimates of from our combined model have not been skewed substanially by the added complexity and assumptions involved in producing the the combined models. 
**should we talk about the effects of any covariates? I have a nice fig of relative depth preferences of each species**

These models produce bienniel estimates of the spatial distribution of biomass density for each species which can be illustrated along with survey biomass estimates (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-all) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-all)); however, we will focus on the predicted spatial variation for the most recent years in our survey data (2018 through 2020 in order to have complete spatial coverage) and prediction for 2019 and 2020 combined (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-2020) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-2020)).
Due to generally higher biomass densities in the north, zooming in on the area immediately around the CDA (aka. area 3CD5A south of 50º) is also useful (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-preds-2020-closeup) and \@ref(fig:ye-preds-2020-closeup)). 
The predictions for both species can also be mapped as ratios in order to identify locations at particular risk of higher YE catch (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-per-hal-preds-2020)) or locations that are particularly productive for halibut, while minimizing YE catch (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-per-ye-preds-2020)).

The CDA covers `r r2(((sum(cda_grid$area)/10000) / ((sum(cda_grid$area)/10000) + (sum(noncda_grid$area)/10000)))*100)`% of area 3CD5A's total surveyed area, excluding RCAs.

The ratio of YE to halibut within the CDA averages lower overall (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-through-time)). 
However, if the same number of cells from the CDA or non-CDA 3CD5A are selected that have the highest density of landable halibut, the expected ratio of YE to landable halibut would not differ between the areas (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-scenario) A). However, if selecting cells only to avoid YE, the ratio of YE to landable halibut biomass expected within the CDA would increasing sharply once more than 10% (or >250 kg/km2) of the CDA was sampled, while a lower YE ratio could be maintained while sampling from an equivelent area until the sampled area exceeded `r signif(non_cda_exceeds_cda, digits = 2)` km2 of the non-CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-scenario)).

Over the roughly 14-year timespan of this index (2007-2019 for QCS trawl survey area; 2008-2018 for WCVI trawl survey area; 2007-2020 for HBLL), overall landable Halibut biomass has fluctuated from a high of `r round(i_hal[i_hal$year==2014,]$est/1000)` tonnes in 2013-2014 to low of `r round(i_hal[i_hal$year==2018,]$est/1000)` tonnes in 2017-2018 (sum of red and blue in Fig. \@ref(fig:indexes) A), while total YE biomass fluctuated from a high of `r round(i_ye[i_ye$year==2008,]$est/1000)` tonnes in 2013-2014 to low of `r round(i_ye[i_ye$year==2020,]$est/1000)` tonnes in 2017-2018 (sum of red and blue in Fig. \@ref(fig:indexes) B).
While index trajectories for both species are similar inside versus outside the CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:indexes-avg)), the difference in species ratio between the CDA and the wider area has been reduced in the most recent years (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-through-time)).

If fishing were to focuse only on the 10% of area with the highest halibut densities, the estimated mean ratios of YE to halibut range from `r round(ye_per_hal_cda[1],2)` to `r round(ye_per_hal_cda[2],2)` within the CDA. 
<!-- Overall, this ratio varies more between years than with total proportion of the CDA targeted for halibut (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-targetting-by-year)).  -->
In contrast, if fishing was focused on avoiding the 50% of the CDA grid area with the highest YE abundances, this ratio could be expected to stay below `r round(ye_per_hal_cda_min[2],4)`. 
While outside the CDA, a similar approach used to fish the same total area could be expected to keep the ratio of YE to halibut below `r round(ye_per_hal_noncda_min[2],4)` (Figs. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-scenario)<!-- and \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-avoiding-by-year) -->).

<!-- and much more pronounced fluctuations in the amount of halibut relative to YE within the CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-ratio-through-time)).  -->
<!-- Building similar models from International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) survey data could provide alternate estimates of catch ratios, but the local resolution would be coarser.  -->
