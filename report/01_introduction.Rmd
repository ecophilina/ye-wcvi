# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

* Yelloweye Rockfish (YE)
* Hard Bottom Longline survey (HBLL)
* Court Defined Area (CDA)

# Methods {#sec:methods}

* We fit geostatistical spatial/spatiotemporal models to the HBLL survey data using the R package sdmTMB <https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB>. 

* The HBLL survey focuses on rockfish habitats, rather than a broader range of habitats and depths that halibut occupy.  Therefore, the proportion of halibut available may be quite different if calculated across the whole area. 

* For YE, the spatiotemporal correlation was minimal and so we used a spatial model with annual mean parameters. Spatiotemporal correlation was considerable for Halibut, and so we used a spatiotemporal model. Our Halibut model is very similar to the model used by the IPHC for index standardization.

* We used a negative binomial observation model with a log link and an an 'offset' for number of hooks. This means we are modelling fish caught per hook but with a statistical approach that lets us use a count distribution. The negative binomial distribution lets the observation variance scale quadratically with the mean, which is typically needed for this type of data.

* We are not accounting for hook competition currently---the outside YE assessment chose to ignore it after some analysis. This could be included.

* We have many diagnostic and validation plots; they are not included here.

* We have included a quadratic effect of depth, annual means for years, and latent "random fields" for spatial and, in the case of Halibut, spatiotemporal fields. These random fields soak up remaining spatial or spatiotemporal correlation from predictors not explicitly included in the model.

* We then calculate expected fish caught for HBLL grid cells in a particular region for a given constant number of hooks and sum these values to come up with an expected number for grid cells within each region.

# Discussion

* Currently, these calculations are based on only the HBLL survey grid within the various boundaries. 

* Adding static covariates like bottom type would create more fine-scale spatial resolution to the predictions. While this is unlikely to change these calculations qualitatively within the HBLL grids, it might allow extrapolation beyond the survey grid. However, extrapolation to inadequately sampled habitat types is still problematic.

* We have not presented uncertainty on the inside vs. outside CDA ratios; this is possible but would require additional work.

* Building similar models from International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) survey data could provide alternate estimates of catch ratios, but the local resolution would be coarser.
