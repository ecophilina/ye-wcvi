# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

* Yelloweye Rockfish (YE)
* Hard Bottom Longline survey (HBLL)
* Court Defined Area (CDA)

# Methods {#sec:methods}

We fit geostatistical spatiotemporal models to the southern outside Hard Bottom Longline survey (HBLL) and synoptic trawl survey data using the R package sdmTMB <https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB>. 
The HBLL survey focuses on rockfish habitats, rather than a broader range of habitats and depths that halibut occupy. 
This survey is usually conducted in alternating years, except that no survey occurred in both 2012 and 2013. 
The synoptic trawl surveys sample soft-bottom habitats, but use a different gear type and record biomass densities, rather than fish counts as on the HBLLL. 
Two of these surveys overlap spatially with the HBLL: the southern portion with the West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey conducted in even years (except 2020 due to covid **is this true?**), and the northern portion with the Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey conducted in odd years.
In order to stitch all three of these surveys together and produce estimates of local variation in biomass density, we pooled odd and even year pairs and converted the catch counts from the HBLL into biomass densities. 
HBLL catch counts are converted to biomass using an estimate of mean weight (currently using all fish sampled on the trawl surveys, because we don't have the Halibut measurements from the HBLL in our database and yelloweye sizes do not seem differ between the survey types). 
This biomass estimate is further divided by the "area swept" calculation of hook count x a hook spacing of 0.0024384 km) x an assumed catch radius of 0.009144 km and converted from km2.
Both this density and that from the trawl survey data are then converted from kg per km2 to kg per ha. 
**is this going to make my index values inflated? In other words, does the calculation assume that the units are at a particular spatial scale?**

Spatiotemporal correlation was much higher for Halibut than from YE, but improved model fit for both > delta 10 AIC. 
For Halibut, including an AR1 correlation between spatiotemporal fields only marginally improved model fit (~5 AIC), so we use independent spatiotemporal fields for both species. 
Our Halibut model is very similar to the model used by the IPHC for index standardization. **still true without an AR1?**
We use a Tweedie...

Survey type is included in the model as a fixed effect that captures differences in both selectivity **is that the right word?** and in the habitat types represented in the two survey types. 
We also include a quadratic effect of depth, annual means for years, and latent "random fields" for spatial and spatiotemporal fields. 
These random fields soak up remaining spatial or spatiotemporal correlation from predictors not explicitly included in the model.
If we added a substrate layer that could more fully account for the difference in habitats represented by the survey types, than the fixed effect of survey type would be mostly an estimate of differences in selectivity which might allow for somewhat better extrapolation of predicted catch between gear types and into neighbouring unsampled grid cells. 

**should we include this bit and the comparison fig?**
We also built models based on just the HBLL data to confirm that stiching of the survey types was still representative of the HBLL survey results. 
For this count-based model we used a negative binomial observation model with a log link and an an 'offset' for number of hooks. 
This means we are modelling fish caught per hook, but with a statistical approach that lets us use a count distribution. 
The negative binomial distribution lets the observation variance scale quadratically with the mean, which is typically needed for this type of data. 
- Describe predictions to matching grid and post-modeling conversion to biomass density
- include fig in results? 

We are not accounting for hook competition in any of these models because the goal here is to estimate likely catch ratios and not the underlying abundances. 

**should we add any diagnostic and validation plots?**

We then calculate expected fish densities for only those 2x2 km grid cells included in either the HBLL or trawl surveys, catch estimates are based on HBLL survey type, if a cell is part of the that grid, otherwise assumed to be better represenated by the trawl survey values.

We then calculate expected fish densities for all grid cells in a particular region for a given constant number of hooks and sum these values to come up with an expected number for grid cells within each region.

# Discussion

Over the roughly 14-year timespan of this index (2007-2019 for QCS trawl survey area; 2008-2018 for WCVI trawl survey area; 2007-2020 for HBLL), overall Halibut biomass has fluctuated from a high of `r round(i_hal[i_hal$year==2014,]$est)` in 2013-2014 to low of `r round(i_hal[i_hal$year==2018,]$est)`in 2017-2018 (Fig. \@ref(fig:halibut-indexes)), while YE biomass fluctuated from a high of `r round(i_ye[i_ye$year==2008,]$est)` kg/ha in 2013-2014 to low of `r round(i_ye[i_ye$year==2020,]$est)`in 2017-2018 (Fig. \@ref(fig:yelloweye-indexes)).

Current results are based on average trawl survey catch weight per fish for both species. 
YE mean weights in trawl (`r round(yemeanweightSYN, 2)` kg) are nearly identical to that from hook and line surveys (`r round(yemeanweightHBLL, 2)` kg) and the similar to placeholder value from IFMP that represents mean of landed commercial catch (`r round(yemeanweight, 2)` kg). 
It is expected that halibut caught on hook and line surveys average larger, but we do not currently have that data.
The mean weight of halibut caught on trawl (`r round(halmeanweightSYN, 2)` kg) differs so dramatically from the mean weigth of fish landed commercially of `r round(halmeanweight, 2)` kg, that **I did not** use this value to convert HBLL survey catch for use in a model with trawl catch.  **I think we need the actual halibut weights from the HBLL... someone much have this data!**
Changing this value would increase the biomass of halibut expected in HBLL grid cells of which there is a much higher proportion within the cda `r round(nrow(hbll_cda_grid)/nrow(cda_grid)*100)`% vs. 
`r round(nrow(hbll_noncda_grid)/nrow(noncda_grid)*100)`% outside it. 
This would be expected to result less overlap in expected ratios of the two species in these areas, but no change in the qualitative patterns.  


While index trajectories for both species are similar inside versus outside the CDA (Figs. \@ref(fig:halibut-indexes-avg) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-indexes-avg)), the differences between species have led to increasing overlap in the expected ratios of YE to halibut biomass inside versus outside the CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-through-time)) and much more pronounced fluctuations in the amount of halibut relative to YE within the CDA (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-ratio-through-time)). The ratio of yellow to halibut within the CDA averages lower overall, but the CI intervals overlap with that for the rest of region 3CD (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-through-time)). 

If the biomass densities are rescaled to estimates in grams per 100 hooks **and halibut mean weights are assumed to be 1.33 times larger in the commercial catch than in the trawl survey--this step won't be needed once the model biomass estimates are more appropriately scaled but for now I think it gets us closer to the what the ultimate patterns will be** and fishing only focuses on cells with the highest halibut densities, the estimated mean ratios of YE to halibut range from `r round(ye_per_hal_cda[1],2)` to `r round(ye_per_hal_cda[2],2)` within the CDA. 
Overall, this ratio varies more between years than with total proportion of the CDA targeted for halibut (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-hal-max-area)). 
However, if a similar number of cells the highest halibut density cells were targeted in region 5A the relative YE catch would be expected to be higher, than in than in 3CD.
In contrast, if fishing is focused slowly on avoiding YE and limited to 50% of the CDA grid area, this ratio is expected to stay below `r round(ye_per_hal_cda_min[2],2)`. 
While outside the CDA, a similar approach used to fish a same size of area could be expected to keep the ratio of YE to halibut below `r round(ye_per_hal_noncda_min[2],3)` (Fig. \@ref(fig:ye-ratio-by-ye-min-area)).

The ratio of halibut to YE reaches similar asymptotes for CDA and non-CDA 3CD with increasing area fished when targeting cells with the most halibut (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-ratio-by-hal-max-area)). However, when attempt to avoid YE within the CDA the ratio of halibut biomass to YE begins declining once fishing occurs in more than 10% of the CDA (or above ~250 km2), while higher halibut ratios can be maintained while fishing an area equivelent to the entire CDA in the other regions (Fig. \@ref(fig:hal-ratio-by-ye-min-area)).

Currently, these calculations are based on only the HBLL and trawl survey grids within the various boundaries. Missing areas includes pretected areas, and cells within the trawl grid but with substrate unsuitable for trawling (presence of rocks, coral, or sponges). 
While our predictions cover the majority of most of the fishing areas in question **(is this accurate?)**, adding substrate layers (at least something like proportion rocky) to these models could allow us to predict for the missing cells. 

Adding static covariates like bottom type would also create more fine-scale spatial resolution to the predictions. While this is unlikely to change these calculations qualitatively, it would be likely to enhance our confidence in our predictions.

Building similar models from **(or including in this model using it's own conversion for hook area swept?)** International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) survey data could provide alternate estimates of catch ratios, but the local resolution would be coarser.
